# Rawr 

created this library to help work with text-adventure games in a more flexible environment than IF.

Rawr was made with the sole purpose of allow art and literature to work together in a way to make text-adventure more intuitive and therefore easier to play.

# Cooperate

Rawr is just a series of classes and interfaces that can be used to make a text-adventure game. 
Just there to be read and to add anything that may be useful or fix anything to wasteful.
